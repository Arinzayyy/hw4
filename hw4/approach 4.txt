Initialize variables: minLength to store the minimum length subarray found so far, sumArray to track the cumulative sum of elements, and a deque (monoQueue) to maintain a non-increasing order of elements' indices.

Iterate through the nums array, and at each step, update the sumArray by adding the current element's value.

While sumArray is greater than or equal to k, pop elements from the left of the deque and update the minLength. These popped elements correspond to subarrays with a sum at least k. Continue this process until sumArray is no longer greater than or equal to k.

Finally, return minLength if it has been updated during the iteration; otherwise, return -1.
