Approach 3


Convert the max heap into a max-heap-like structure by negating all elements in the array. This effectively reverses the order of elements, turning them into a min-heap-like structure.

Use the heapq module (Python's built-in heap library) to create a heap from the modified array.

Extract the top k elements from the heap. Since the heap is a min-heap with the modified values, you will get the largest k elements in the original max heap.

Negate the results to revert them to their original values.

The time complexity is dominated by O(k * log n).
